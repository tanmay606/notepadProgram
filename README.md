# notepadProgram
NotepadPlusPlus, is my personal note-taking project, that uses encryption to hold your personal notes and text, it uses a combination of SHA1 and md5 to secure the data.

It lets you create a note, edit a note, and delete a note, and the beautiful thing is that you need a file name to edit delete, or even access your notes, if you do not have a file name with you, you can't access the note saved on the server.
